- 👋 Hi, I’m @bocato, currently serving as a Lead iOS Software Engineer & Manager for the CONFIRMED App @adidas in Amsterdam, originally from Brazil 🇧🇷. My expertise lies in Swift/Objective-C, with a strong passion for modularization, testing, and software design and architecture.
- 👀 I’m deeply interested in mobile development, focusing on iOS architectures and enhancing team culture through innovative programming techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently broadening my skills in Kotlin, refreshing my Android knowledge, diving into Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), and exploring a bit of JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on Swift open source projects and engage in community discussions. Additionally, I'm offering mentoring sessions at https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/eduardobocato/ to share my knowledge and experience.
